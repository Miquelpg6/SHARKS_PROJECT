Project-1-Pandas
Overview
This aim of this project is to clean and format a dataset containing information about shark attacks, and use the data to produce visualizations that will either prove or disprove my hypotheses.

Requirements/Libraries Used:
This code was written in Python/Jupyter Notebook, using the following libraries:

Numpy
Pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
Seaborn

Hypotheses:

1- South Africa is a save country to practice water sports.
2- Summer is the best season to go to South Africa.
3- Analyse each region most dangerous activity and when are shark attacks happening for each activity.

1 - South Africa is a save country to practice water sports:

The first part of the analysis has been focused on searching which are the most dangerous coutnries in the world, in other words, where have been more attacks througout the times. The study has revelead that USA is the country with more attacks, with 2.229 reports, Australia is in the second position with 1.338 attacks and South Africa is ranked 3rd with 579. As we wanted to travel to South Africa this summer, we will take a closer look to the most dangerous regions in the country and when are those happening.

2- Summer is the best season to go to South Africa:

We would like to travel there in South African summer (December, January and February). We are hoping that the attacks are produced in the winter, as we know sharks like the cold water. 
Surprisingly as we can see on the plot below, summer months have the higer number of attacks registered, January with 106 attacks registered, December with 68 and February with 56. After seeing that summer is the most dangerous season in South Africa we would like to analyse deeply every region of South Africa and wich activities are the most dangerous.

3- Analisis of each region most dangerous activity and when is happening

In the third part of the analysis we will focus on each region of South Africa. We have found that there are 3 major regions where Shark attacks happen, Eastern Cape Province, Western Cape Province, KwaZulu-Natal. Eastern Cape has had during its history a total of 160 reported shark attacks, that a 28,2 % of the three most reported regions in South Africa. Western Cape has reported a total of 195 shark attacks in the second position. And the most dangerous area in South Africa is KwaZulu-Natal with a total of 213 reported shark attacks.


Knowing that this regions have a high number of attacks we want to know for each region which is the most common activity for each region when attacks happen and in which month are most likely to happen:

- Eastern Cape Province: After the analisis we have found that the activity with a higher number of attacks in Eastern Cape Province is Surfing with 58 registered attacks. In this region we should take care doing this activity in the months of July with 14 attack, May with 8 attack and February with 6 attacks.

- Western Cape Province: The activity with higer reported attack numbers is Spearfishing with 27 reported shark attacks. If we want to do this activity safely we should take care in the months of September with 4 attack reports, December wih also 4 and February with a total of 3 attacks.

- KwaZulu-Natal: For the region of KwaZulu-Natal, we have found that the most dangerous activity is Swimming, with a total of 34 reported shark attacks in the history of the region. If we want to go for a swim in this region we should take care in months like January with 9 attacks reports, November with 5 reports nd February with also 5 reports.

In conclusion if we want to travel to South Africa we should know that is a dangerous country, ranked 3rd on most shark attacks. If you still want to travel there keep in mind to NEVER do it on the summer, as we have seen that is the most dangerous season. If you do it try not to practice Surf in Eastern Cape , Spearfishing in Western Cape and Swimming in KwaZulu-Natal.
